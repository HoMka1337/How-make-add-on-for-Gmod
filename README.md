I'll teach you how to make your own addon for the game Gmod,don’t worry that it will be difficult to do them, there is a Wiki for this, before you start you need to know at least something about lua, so let's get started, first of all you need to go to the root folder Garry's Mod, secondly, go to the folder where all your addons are located, then there we create a folder for your addon, in this folder we make another folder lua, if you want to make your own weapons or scripts or gamemode or uu and etc., then you need folders like "autorun, bin, derma, drive, effects, entities, inducles, includes, matproxy, menu, postprocess, vgui, weapons, gamemodes, models, sound, resource, particels, material." I’ll write you all their identifications, so don’t worry, everything will work out for you.
